Q1:
Spring 3.0: Introduced support for Java 5 features, such as annotations and generics. Also introduced a new Spring Expression Language (SpEL) for querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime.
Spring 3.1: Introduced support for Java 7, as well as a new caching abstraction and a new environment profile feature.
Spring 4.0: Introduced support for Java 8, as well as a new @RestController annotation for building RESTful web services.
Spring 4.3: Introduced a new @Test annotation for integration testing and a new @Before and @After annotations for unit testing.
Spring 5.0: Introduced support for the Java 9, support for reactive programming with Spring WebFlux, functional web framework and functional bean definition in Spring Framework.
Spring 5.2: Introduced support for the Java 11 and new features in JDK like HTTP client.
Spring 6: Introduced support for Java 14, and new features like Spring Security WebFlux, Spring Data R2DBC, and more.

Q2:
The Spring Framework is an open-source application framework for the Java platform.
It makes it easier to build enterprise-grade applications by providing a core set of features, such as dependency injection.
It is a modular framework thus only the required features can be used by the developers.

Q3: 
Modularity: Spring is based on a modular design, which allows developers to use only the parts of the framework that they need, rather than having to use the entire framework.
Dependency Injection: Spring's dependency injection feature allows for easier management of object dependencies, making code more readable and maintainable.
Data Access: Spring provides a consistent data access framework that supports multiple database technologies, making it easy to switch between different databases.
MVC Framework: Spring's MVC framework provides a clean separation of concerns between the model, view, and controller, making it easy to build web applications.
Transaction Management: Spring's transaction management feature allows for easy management of transactions across different data access technologies.
AOP Support: Spring's AOP support allows for the separation of cross-cutting concerns, such as logging and security, from the main application code.
Testability: Spring's design makes it easy to write unit tests for the application code, making it easier to maintain and improve the codebase over time.
Extensibility: Spring's extensibility allows developers to add custom functionality to the framework, making it more versatile.
Lightweight: Spring is lightweight and doesn't require a lot of resources to run. 

Q4:
Some of the features offered by Spring Framework include:
Inversion of Control (IoC) container
Aspect-oriented programming (AOP)
Data access framework
Transaction management
MVC web framework


Q5:
Main categories are:
Core Container: This category includes the IoC container, which is the foundation of the Spring Framework. It provides the basic functionality for dependency injection, such as BeanFactory and ApplicationContext.
Data Access/Integration: This category includes modules for data access and integration, such as JDBC, ORM, and OXM, as well as transaction management.
Web: This category includes modules for building web applications, such as the Spring MVC web framework, web-socket, and web services (RESTful and SOAP).
AOP and Instrumentation: This category includes modules for aspect-oriented programming and class instrumentation, such as AspectJ and instrumentation support.
Test: This category includes modules for testing Spring-based applications, such as the Spring TestContext Framework, JUnit, and TestNG.
Additional Modules: This category includes additional modules such as Spring Batch, Spring Integration, Spring Security, Spring Web Flow and Spring Data.

Q6:
A Spring configuration file is an XML, Java, or Groovy file used to define the beans (objects) that make up the application context in a Spring application.
The file typically contains information such as bean class names, property values, and bean dependencies.
This configuration file is used by the Spring Framework to create and manage the beans in the application.

Q7:
A Spring application typically has several components, including:
Controllers: handle incoming HTTP requests and return appropriate responses.
Services: provide business logic and interact with databases or other external resources.
Repositories: handle data access and provide an abstraction over the underlying storage mechanism (such as a relational database).
Models: represent domain objects and their relationships.
Views: handle the presentation of data to the user (in web applications, this typically involves templates).
Configurations: handle the configuration of the application, such as setting up the data source, security, and other settings.

Q8:
As a standalone framework: Spring can be used as a standalone framework for building applications by providing a wide range of functionality, including dependency injection, data access, and more.
As a web application framework: Spring can be used to build web applications by leveraging its support for web-specific features such as controllers, views
As a Microservices framework.

Q9:
The Spring Inversion of Control (IOC) container is a core component of the Spring Framework. 
It is responsible for managing the instantiation, configuration, and lifecycle of objects, also known as beans.
The IOC container uses dependency injection (DI) to manage the dependencies between beans. 

Q10:
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows an object to receive its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. 
This allows for a separation of concerns, where an object only needs to worry about its core functionality and not how to obtain its dependencies.
In Spring Framework, Dependency Injection is achieved through the use of the Inversion of Control (IOC) container. 
There are 2 types of Dependency Injection:
Constructor-based Dependency Injection: The dependencies are supplied to the object through its constructor.
Setter-based Dependency Injection: The dependencies are supplied to the object through setter methods.

Q11:
To Install Spring Boot in Intellij Idea
1: We first go to Spring website to generate a project with the required build tool like Maven and then the dependencies.
2: After this we open the folder from files section in intelij.
3. Our Spring project is ready and new dependencies can be added in the pom.xml file.

Q12:
In the Application.Properties file we can add server.port = 9090 to change the default port.

Q13:
The whitelabel error page, which is the default error page can be configured by creating a personalised error.html page.

Q15:
If there is use of Annotations then we can very well say the project is using Application Context which is not the case in BeanFactory.
Bean Factory implements XMLBeanFactory whereas Application Context can use ClassPath/FileSystem/WebXmlApplicationContext.

Q16:
@autowired is used for Dependency Injection while @qualifier is used along with @autowired to remove ambiguity between beans,
On the other hand @Injection works the same as @autowired but is part of Java CDI.
This annotation can work alongside any framework making it loosely coupled as compared to @autowired which is part of Spring.
